characters in a numeric field);
- the data entered by the user is incorrect (for example, a negative price of an item);
- the file with the data does not exist;
- nothing was found for the search data entered;
- the number of the record to be deleted is outside the array/vector;
- the login for the new account already exists;
- the ability to go back (navigation);
- a request to perform irreversible processes, namely, confirmation of deletion,
for "Do you really want to delete the file (record)?";
- user feedback, for example, displaying a message about
success of file creation/deletion of a record/etc.
